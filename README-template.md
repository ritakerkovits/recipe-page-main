## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

Discovered the **li::marker pseudo-element** in CSS.
It allowed precise customization of list markers, enhancing the visual appeal of lists on the website.

Te code I used:
```css
.ingredients li::marker{
  color: #7B3C28;
  font-size: 0.8rem ;
}
```


### Continued development

In upcoming projects, I intend to sharpen my proficiency in **Flexbox**. While I've utilized this layout technique effectively, I aim to dig deeper into its advanced features.
Also I would like to apply the **CSS Grid** techniques as well in these kind of projects.

Besides improving my proficiency in **Flexbox and CSS Grid**, I'm also looking to enhance the **HTML structures** in my projects.  I want to make sure my HTML is not just functional but also easy to understand and work with, following best practices.
